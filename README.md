# P2-Einsteins Calculator Project Page
* Welcome to the calculator project page. Here you can find the complied list of calculators organized by the navbar at the top. Read through our projects and visit the code comments if you are interested in any further details.
## Git Instructions
* You can learn about running this project on your IDE in this section:
* Go to Code home and click on the green "Code" button.
* Click on the clipboard next to the Git url.
* Open up your IntelliJ and click "Run from Version Control".
* Press "Ctrl + V" or "âŒ˜ + V" and press the blue "Clone" button at the bottom.
* Once the project is opened up, be sure to change the interpreter to Python 3.8 or above.

## Navigation
* At the top you will see a navigation bar, to return to home from anywhere, you can either click "Main Menu" or the "Home" buttons.
* You can click through the basic and scientific calculator.
* The basic calculator is a 4 function calculator that will offer you calculations form the four basic functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* For more advanced users, the scientific calculator includes the four functions as well as trigonometric calculations.
* So far, both calculators will be text based, therefore, requireing the user to press run in the console window to start the calcuator programs, however, soon a GUI will be added to allow ease of use without external consoles.
* To learn more about the calculators themselves, their repositories are linked below the console windows. 
## Code Breakdown
* Jinja: This is a useful templating tool that is used in our project to manage the links and different aspects of structuring around our website. The Jinja works in tandem with our html and python so the linkage between the backend and frontend is seamless.
* Bootstrap: Our navigation bar is sourced from Boostrap. The navbar is another level of integration with the backend as the navbar is directly connected to the app.routes which allows us to put our url decorations in main.py to use and have different directories each with a unique project in this case calculators.
